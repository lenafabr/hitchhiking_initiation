Instructions for calculating linker-mediated contact rates between organelles using Brownian Dynamics simulations
## The accompanying code was developed by Saurabh S. Mogre and Elena F. Koslover
## Contact smogre@ucsd.edu for queries regarding the code

1) Simulating organelle movement
-> The folder 'source' contains FORTRAN 90 source files required to generate the executable
-> gfortran or equivalent FORTRAN 90 compiler is required to compile the files
-> navigate to source/ and run the command make to compile.
-> run the executable spheretouchBD.exe with a parameter file name as argument.


Example parameter files are provided for the diffusive and tethered case. For example, the following command:

./spheretouchBD.exe BDsim_3endo_5MT_diff

 will run the simulation with 3 endosomes, 5 microtubule tracks, and a diffusive peroxisome.
Parameters can be changed by editing the param.* file. Adjustable parameters are listed in source/readkey.f90. Documentation on the parameters and input formating will be provided upon request.

-> The simulation will output a *.snap.out file containing all the positions and orientations of the involved organelles.

2) Reading simulation data
-> Run the script makeMatfromSnap.m in matlab to read in data from the *.snap.out file and extract positions and orientations to a .mat
file

3) Calculating linker contact rate
-> run the script getContactRate.m to calculate the linker contact rate.
